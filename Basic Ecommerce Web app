PROJECT - 2: Basic E-Commerce Web App (HTML, CSS, JS)
Algorithm
Start by designing a basic HTML structure:

Use a <div class="container"> to hold the entire content.
Add an <h1> for the "Products" heading and an empty <div id="product-list"> where products will be dynamically added via JavaScript.
Create a section for the shopping cart:

Add an <h2> labeled "Shopping Cart".
Include a <div id="cart-items"> to list cart items.
Use a <p id="empty-cart"> as a placeholder for an empty cart message.
Create a hidden <div id="cart-total"> to display the total price and a "Checkout" button once items are added.
Style the page using styles.css:

Apply styles for layout, spacing, button design, and visibility toggling using .hidden class.
In JavaScript:

Define a list of products as objects with properties like name, price, and image.
Render products in the #product-list dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
Add a button to each product to allow adding items to the cart.
Handle cart state:
Use an array to store added products.
Update the cart items list and total price dynamically.
Show/hide the #cart-total and #empty-cart based on cart contents.
Attach event listeners to "Add to Cart" and "Checkout" buttons:
On adding, update the cart array and UI.
On checkout, clear the cart and display a thank-you message (optional).
End the script.
